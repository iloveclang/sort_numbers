Some guy on reddit wanted his homework done again:

> Hi everyone, I need some help with a program I need to write for a STEM club after school.
>
> The program is about calculations with resistors for an electrical circuit. The teacher wants us to us a formula for the calculations using 5 variables and then record the output every time and put it into an array i think she said. after repeating the calculations 5 times we are supposed to order the outputs in numerical order biggest to smallest and then show them. I dont really know where to start with it and I cant understand the videos on youtube so any help would be appreciated.

> Thanks also sorry if this doesnt make much sense we havent done much programming at my school.
